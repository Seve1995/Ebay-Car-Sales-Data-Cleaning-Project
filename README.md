# Ebay Car Sales Data Project
## Description
In this project we'll analyze a dataset of used cars listed in the **eBay Kleinanzeigen**, a classified section of the German eBay website.

Since this project aims to practice with data cleaning techniques, we'll use a reduced and modified version of the [Used cars database](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data), that has the following modifications:
- We sampled 50,000 data points from the original dataset to reduce computation time
- We dirtied the dataset a bit to work with a version of the dataset closer to a real situation of non cleaned data

The goal of the project is to clean the data and perform some analysis on the included used car listings.
